Python for loop with Range
This code uses a Python for loop with index in conjunction with the range() function to generate a sequence of
 numbers starting from 0, up to (but not including) 10, and with a step size of 2.
 For each number in the sequence, the loop prints its value using the print() function. 
 The output will show the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.


for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
