5 operators in 2D arrays are 

1. Accessing Elements:
  Allows you to retrieve a specific element from the 2D array using its indices.

2. Adding Matrices: 
Enables you to add two matrices element-wise, resulting in a new matrix with the sum of corresponding elements.

3. Transposing a Matrix: 
Allows you to switch the rows and columns of a matrix, effectively creating a new matrix where the rows of the original matrix become columns and vice versa.

4. Multiplying by a Scalar:
 Enables you to multiply each element of the matrix by a scalar value, resulting in a new matrix where each element is scaled by the scalar.

5. Checking Existence of an Element:
 Enables you to check if a specific element exists within the 2D array, returning a boolean value indicating whether the element is present or not.
