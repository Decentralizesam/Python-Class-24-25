Bitwise operators


: ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Python arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations on numeric 
data, such as addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulus(%), exponentiation(//), 
and floor division. 
Python arithmetic operators can be applied to various data types, including integers,
floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

: LOGICAL OPERATORS
In Python, logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean value (True or False).
The two most commonly used logical operators are 'and' and 'or'. 
some programmers might be used to using '&&' as a logical operator from other programming languages.

: INEQUALITY OPERATORS
The Python equality operator ( == ) checks if two variables or values are equal. 
The result of the evaluation is either True or False. 
The equality operator returns True if the values are equal. 
If the values aren't equal, the comparison returns False.

: ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by its left-hand operand.
 The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand.
