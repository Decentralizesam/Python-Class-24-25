: ARITHEMETIC OPERATORS EXAMPLE

# Example 1 
x = 5
y = 3

print(x + y)

# Example 2
x = 5
y = 3

print(x + y)

# Example 3


x = 10
y = 5

print(x - y)

# Example 4

w = 100
z = 50

print(w * z)

# Example 5

x = 10
y = 2

print(x / y)

# Example 6

a = 6
b = 10

print(a % b)


 : LOGICAL OPERATORS EXAMPLE

# Example 1

x = 5

print(x > 3 and x < 10)

# Returns True because (5) is greater than (3 & 5) is less than (10)

# Example 2

x = 5

print(x > 3 or x < 4)

# Returns True because one of the conditions are true (5 is greater than 3, but 5 is not less than 4)

# Example 3

x = 5

print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))

# Returns False because not is used to reverse the result, so not(5>3 and 5<10) is False

# Example 4

x = 2

print(x > 1 and x < 5)

# Returns True because both conditions are true (2 is greater than 1, and 2 is less than 5)

# Example 5

x = 2

print(x > 1 or x < 4)

# Returns True because one of the conditions are true (2 is greater than 1, but 2 is not less than 4)


: INEQUALITY OPERATORS EXAMPLE

# In Python, the 'not equal' operator is represented by '! ='.
# It's a comparison operator used to compare two values.
 #The operator returns True if the values are not equal and False if they are equal.

 # Example 1 

 x = "10"
 y = 10

 print(x!=y)

 # returns true because x is not equal to y

 #Example 2

 x = 5
y = 3

print(x == y)

# returns False because 5 is not equal to 3


:ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS EXAMPLE

# Example 1

x = 5

print(x)

# Example 2

x = 5

x += 3

print(x)
