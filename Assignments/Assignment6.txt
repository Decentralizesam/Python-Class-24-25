1. QN : How to call a function into another function

To call a function in Python, you simply type the name of the function followed by parentheses (). 
If the function takes any arguments, they are included within the parentheses.

2. how to call a function into another function


 Define both functions: 
Define both functions separately. Each function should have its own purpose and set of instructions.

 Purpose: 
Understand what each function does. One function might gather information (like name, age, course), while the other might display or process that information.

 Call one function from another: 
To use the functionality of one function within another, simply call the function inside the other function. You do this by writing the function's name followed by parentheses ().

 Pass arguments:
 If the inner function requires any arguments, make sure to pass them when calling the function inside another function.

Use the returned value (optional): 
If the inner function returns any value, you can capture and use that value in the outer function.
