Steps involved when creating / developing a model 
    1.Understand the business problem and define success criteria
    2.Understand and identify data needs
    3.Collect, clean and prepare the data for model training
    4.Determine the model's features and train it   
    

    
ADDITIONAL STEPS 
    Collecting Data:
    Choosing a Model: 
    Training the Model: 
    Evaluating the Model: 
    Parameter Tuning: 
    Making Predictions    
       
Step 1: Data Collection for Machine Learning
Step 2: Preprocessing and Preparing Your Data
Step 3: Selecting the Right Machine Learning Model
Step 4: Training Your Machine Learning Model
Step 5: Evaluating Model Performance
Step 6: Tuning and Optimizing Your Model



Machine learning models are built into six steps:
    Data access and collection,
    Data preparation
    Exploration
    Model build and train, 
    Model evaluation, 
    Model deployment
    Model monitoring.
