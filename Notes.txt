Steps
The following are the steps to write a Python program to print Hello World â€“

Step 1: Install Python. Make sure that Python is installed on your system or not. If Python is not installed, then install it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Step 2: Choose Text Editor or IDE to write the code.
Step 3: Open Text Editor or IDE, create a new file, and write the code to print Hello World.
Step 4: Save the file with a file name and extension ".py".
Step 5: Compile/Run the program


SCALAR DATE TYPE
VESTORS

A list has items seperated by commas and are inside square brackets
the items cant be of the same data type
data ina list is in sequecent
they are mutable

variable ables us to take in single values
tuple $ list allows us to add in many items
allows us to enter in different items of different data types

we cant have only element in tuple without ending in a commas
tuples are immutable/cant be changed

to delete tuple we say del tuple

converting tuple to list

new_list = list(names) - tuple to list

new_list = tuple(new_list)-

a tuple known by brackets and a list is known by square brackets 

for loop in tuple
for element in new_list:
print(element)

SORTING......

tup2=('a','b','c','d','e','f')
sorted_list=(sorted_list)
sorted_list=tuple(sorted_list)
print(sorted_list)




Assignment 3
operators on the  py list
append
insert

tuple packing


write notes and code examples (each two examples) 

Remove 
pop 
extend 
concatination 
count 
sort 
reverse


Dictorianaries
the values of a dictionary can be of any type but the must b eof an immutable data type either strings,numbers,and tuples
keys are immutable yet list are mutable
a dictionary is mutable
del dict (for deleting the key)
dict clear (for deleting the whole code)


  Reverse ------ print(tup3[::-1])

  Endure(persistent)
  consistency(daily base)

2D arrays in python
5 examples on 5 operations in 2d arrays
how do we implement a switch-case in phython

string anything inside a 'string' or "string"
integers Whole numbers
Boolean true or false
Float decimal points numbers
Double 1000000000000

monday - Projects 

Databases python works with 
Mysql
postgressql
sequecent

2D arrays
we access the value using an index in 2D arrays
2D arrays has columns and rows


Accessing 2D arrays 
(Matrixxxxx)
we shall be using jupyter


FUNCTIONS

Indention in python

keywords in python
str
def
class
return
lift
tuple
print
types

Name convetion of function 

camel case 
stringFunction

pascal case       a class uses pascal case
StringFunction

snake case
string_function


       Functions with parameters and arguments

       if you dont assign anything to the return type it will return None
       printing is different from printing
       two types of function 
       a function that performs a task
       then a return function that performs something and returns None


       keyword argument comes afrter position 

       code versioning - upgrade in code from either version 1 to version 2

       git 
       git Init 
       git add
       git commit
       git push
       git remote

       github.com
       git lab

LOOP 
for loop & while loop
allows us to execute a statement in python


Structure of a for loop 
excute loop untill a certian statement is executed
nested looop is a for loop inside a while loop 
Global veriable scope & local scope
global veriable can be accessed outside & inside the loop
local can be accessed inside the function
any function in python returns something or nothing
pass creates a function which is empty


characters="python"
def looping():
for character in characters:
print(character)
print("all characters are written)
return character

looping()
IF STATEMENTS IN Python

if statement we have the false and true statement
implist calling and explicit calling of statements
implist calling is calling without mentioning the else part 
explicit calling is calling by mentioning the else part

calling of the else can be using the else keyword or leave it in the same line with the function

ELSE-IF
elif stands for elseif 
we dont indent using space but tab
we dont use switch in python 3 but we use match 
match enables us to combine the code to the excuted at the same time

Range in python function

we have starting point 
ending point 

range(start,end,step)
step value is 1 by default
start value is 0 by default
stop

i%2=0 even numbers
break is stop 
continue statementement 




use range function 
use continue statementement
continue should be a function
the start,step and stop should be input values from the terminal 


TOMORROW LESSONS 
Range in python function
main
lambda
split
join


# The parameters are dynamic not static / the user has to manually enter the parameters
start = int(input("Enter the start value: "))
step = int(input("Enter the step value: "))
stop = int(input("Enter the stop value: "))

# iterate over the range
for i in range(start, stop, step):
    # Print even numbers 
    if i % 2 != 0:
        continue
    print(i)

    data structures
list = []
tuple = 
dictionary
sets
2D array

develop an api at the end of the class 
what is an API 
applications programming interfaces
end point in APIS


HTTP 404 doesnt exists
len for determining the length 


emuniration is print the values with the position 
emuniration is a function 
range is a function too 


maximum number in a range of numbers

mylist = list(range(4,20,2))
print(mylist)
sliced_list=mylist[:2]
print(sliced_list)

keywords we shall be using 


tecnical dept 
when we use short cards we shall payy
the more time we take to learn to the basics
Shortcuts are always the wrong road
Research is the best way to learn


lambda is annoynimas function
lamBDA work like a function 

range 
lambda
enumirate
main 



write 5 examples of each of these() functions

Assignmnet 
Create an application that takes in list(use a dict inside a list ) , Dictorianaries and perform the following function join,split and replace


Inheritance in python 
Parent class with child class 
Superclass with subclass

single Inheritance
multiple Inheritance
Inheritance can have parenthesis in the class 
we create an instance from Constructors 

create a class called shape
take in colour as a parameters 
create child class Rectangle
take in clour,length and width as a parameter
calculate the area,and parameter(methods of a rec )
the clour ,length and width should be dynamic 
print the area: ,colour: ,pirameter :
use return
