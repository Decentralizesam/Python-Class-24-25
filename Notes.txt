Steps
The following are the steps to write a Python program to print Hello World â€“

Step 1: Install Python. Make sure that Python is installed on your system or not. If Python is not installed, then install it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Step 2: Choose Text Editor or IDE to write the code.
Step 3: Open Text Editor or IDE, create a new file, and write the code to print Hello World.
Step 4: Save the file with a file name and extension ".py".
Step 5: Compile/Run the program


SCALAR DATE TYPE
VESTORS

A list has items seperated by commas and are inside square brackets
the items cant be of the same data type
data ina list is in sequecent
they are mutable

variable ables us to take in single values
tuple $ list allows us to add in many items
allows us to enter in different items of different data types

we cant have only element in tuple without ending in a commas
tuples are immutable/cant be changed

to delete tuple we say del tuple

converting tuple to list

new_list = list(names) - tuple to list

new_list = tuple(new_list)-

a tuple known by brackets and a list is known by square brackets 

for loop in tuple
for element in new_list:
print(element)

SORTING......

tup2=('a','b','c','d','e','f')
sorted_list=(sorted_list)
sorted_list=tuple(sorted_list)
print(sorted_list)




Assignment 3
operators on the  py list
append
insert

tuple packing


write notes and code examples (each two examples) 

Remove 
pop 
extend 
concatination 
count 
sort 
reverse


Dictorianaries
the values of a dictionary can be of any type but the must b eof an immutable data type either strings,numbers,and tuples
keys are immutable yet list are mutable
a dictionary is mutable
del dict (for deleting the key)
dict clear (for deleting the whole code)


  Reverse ------ print(tup3[::-1])

  Endure(persistent)
  consistency(daily base)

2D arrays in python
5 examples on 5 operations in 2d arrays
how do we implement a switch-case in phython

string anything inside a 'string' or "string"
integers Whole numbers
Boolean true or false
Float decimal points numbers
Double 1000000000000

monday - Projects 

Databases python works with 
Mysql
postgressql
sequecent

2D arrays
we access the value using an index in 2D arrays
2D arrays has columns and rows


Accessing 2D arrays 
(Matrixxxxx)
we shall be using jupyter

Name convetion of function 

camel case 
stringFunction

pascal case       a class uses pascal case
StringFunction

snake case
string_function


       Functions with parameters and arguments

       if you dont assign anything to the return type it will return None
       printing is different from printing
       two types of function 
       a function that performs a task
       then a return function that performs something and returns None


       keyword argument comes afrter position 

       code versioning - upgrade in code from either version 1 to version 2

       git 
       git Init 
       git add
       git commit
       git push
       git remote

       github.com
       git lab
       bit bucket


       master or main  
       branches
