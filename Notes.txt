Steps
The following are the steps to write a Python program to print Hello World â€“

Step 1: Install Python. Make sure that Python is installed on your system or not. If Python is not installed, then install it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Step 2: Choose Text Editor or IDE to write the code.
Step 3: Open Text Editor or IDE, create a new file, and write the code to print Hello World.
Step 4: Save the file with a file name and extension ".py".
Step 5: Compile/Run the program


SCALAR DATE TYPE
VESTORS

A list has items seperated by commas and are inside square brackets
the items cant be of the same data type
data ina list is in sequecent
they are mutable

variable ables us to take in single values
tuple $ list allows us to add in many items
allows us to enter in different items of different data types

we cant have only element in tuple without ending in a commas
tuples are immutable/cant be changed

to delete tuple we say del tuple

converting tuple to list

new_list = list(names) - tuple to list

new_list = tuple(new_list)-

a tuple known by brackets and a list is known by square brackets 

for loop in tuple
for element in new_list:
print(element)

SORTING......

tup2=('a','b','c','d','e','f')
sorted_list=(sorted_list)
sorted_list=tuple(sorted_list)
print(sorted_list)

the values of a dictionary can be of any type but the must b eof an immutable data type either strings,numbers,and tuples
keys are immutable yet list are mutable
a dictionary is mutable
del dict (for deleting the key)

LOOP 
for loop & while loop
allows us to execute a statement in python


Structure of a for loop 
excute loop untill a certian statement is executed
nested looop is a for loop inside a while loop 
Global veriable scope & local scope
global veriable can be accessed outside & inside the loop
local can be accessed inside the function
any function in python returns something or nothing
pass creates a function which is empty


characters="python"
def looping():
for character in characters:
print(character)
print("all characters are written)
return character

looping()
IF STATEMENTS IN Python

if statement we have the false and true statement
implist calling and explicit calling of statements
implist calling is calling without mentioning the else part 
explicit calling is calling by mentioning the else part

calling of the else can be using the else keyword or leave it in the same line with the function

ELSE-IF
elif stands for elseif 
we dont indent using space but tab
we dont use switch in python 3 but we use match 
match enables us to combine the code to the excuted at the same time

Range in python function

we have starting point 
ending point 

range(start,end,step)
step value is 1 by default
start value is 0 by default
stop

i%2=0 even numbers
break is stop 
continue statementement 




use range function 
use continue statementement
continue should be a functions
the start,step and stop should be input values from the terminal 


TOMORROW LESSONS 
Range in python function
main
lambda
split
join


# The parameters are dynamic not static / the user has to manually enter the parameters
start = int(input("Enter the start value: "))
step = int(input("Enter the step value: "))
stop = int(input("Enter the stop value: "))

# iterate over the range
for i in range(start, stop, step):
    # Print even numbers 
    if i % 2 != 0:
        continue
    print(i)

Inheritance in python 
Parent class with child class 
Superclass with subclass

single Inheritance
multiple Inheritance
Inheritance can have parenthesis in the class 
we create an instance(objects) from Constructors 

create a class called shape
take in colour as a parameters 
create child class Rectangle
take in clour,length and width as a parameter
calculate the area,and parameter(methods of a rec )
the clour ,length and width should be dynamic 
print the area: ,colour: ,pirameter :
use return

File handling(reading and writing files)


types of files in file handling 
.txt
.csv
.json 


operations we shall be using 
Writing 
reading
appending 
open 
while
with 



read = R
write = w
append = a 

Download sample files of json format and Csv format
json editor online

# instance(Objects)of a class person(An object is an instance of a class)
# class is a blueprint of which objects are created 

 # super allows the class to initialise the atrributes 
#__init__ allows us to initialize the attributes of a class(it is known as a constructor)
 # allows us to acesss attributes,methods and variable 
 # Constructor is a special methdo that is called when an object is created
 #purpose of a constructor
# it is used to intialize the object's attributes


File handling
# opening a file we use open(function)
# how to open a file
# Modes "r","w","a","b"


uses of Read 

# Acessing data 
# Data processing
# Data transformations
# Data analysis 
# # with enables us to explicitly close the file



differences between  a function and a class 

def function():
class MyClaass:
By using with keyword we can return a context manager as an object 
open() function to open a file in either way to write or read 
pass in python is used as a placeholder for future code

web scripting on Monday 
Html learning 
finish at julyg 18th


what is an API's 
setting up python environment 
 - requests Library (Simplifies making HTTP requests)
 - how we install packages in python 
 1.pip
 2. pip -v (version of python)
 3. pip install requests 

 4. pip freeze > requirements.txt
 each project must have a requirement file ... a requirement file isz used to store all the installed packages
generating all libraries installed in a project 
pip install -r requirements.txt

a package is something developed to easy your work 
an api has a url and an end point 


requests enables us 

404 page not found 
200 page found 
not acceptable 
forbideen 
200 

semrush blog website for http status code 
read the Api doumentation 

http status code 

apis are made up of end points to get the results 
a function performs a task 
authentication ( passwords),login
base url is the default url of the website 
then after the base url we have an end point 
 we have url,headers and parameters 
 api calls ( we need to understand before web scripting)
 we cant do web scripting without beautiful soup 
 web scrapting allows us to take information and make analysis 
 
Research : DATA ANALYSISES 
API token inorder to get the results from a secured website 


a847aa77929479dcf4ac15a3f5c71b28ea646771
authentication should be a key and the token must have a formatter string 


WEB scrapting
processs of extracting data from a secure/insecure website

REASONS : WEB scrapting
1. data collection 
2. data automation script (NCC / BBC ) BACKGROUND TASK FOR SCRIPTING WEBSITES/crpto currencies for data analysis 
3.Monitoring and research (Eg.tech)


Requirements
-beautifulsoup(package that allows us to go to websites )
- html 
- web page(that one is scraping(API/URL))

virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate P1
pip install - 


<html> opening and closing tag 
three elements of html 
1. head
2. body

<p> paragragh
<h2> heading 
<p style="colour:green">
</p>
<body>
m1>


when we want automatic closing we use With(file handling)
to get url we import request 

printing the value of arributes 
arributes in htlm are everything  after a tag 

Web sites are all created with html 

Tags 
element
attributes


Scrfipting a url 
a file that perfomrs a task and has functions is a script 


before installing a package 
we must have a virtual environment(creating another computer in your computer )
virtual is something that doesnt exist but work
Impotance of virtual machine 
to avoid circullar imports
git ignore





MACHINE LEARNING 

Data Scienec:
-Data science is a multi displinary fild that uses scientific ,methods,processes,algorithms and 
 systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data
 (this involves data collection,cleaning,analysis and vizualisation)


 We basically dealing with data and the science init extracts the knowledge 
 data a meaningless information

 PYTHON IN DATA science

 Reasons for using python for data science 
 -widely used because of simplicity,readability and availability of powerful and free packages(libraries)
 - very simple 

 Basic libraries we shall be using : 

 pandas : data manupulation and analysis.
 Numpy : numerical operations
 Matiplotlib : data vizualisation
 scipy : data computing/ computation
 jupyter note book : analysis and data vizualisation


 MACHINE LEARNING 
    Is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on development of algorithms and statistical modules that enables computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on the given data 
algorithms(procedure of doing something/step by step daily routine of doing something )


python for machine learning

- A variety of frameworks and libraries

(libraries in machine learning)
1. Scikit-learn : general purpose machine learning library
2. Tensorflow : Deep learning 

Artificial intelligence(AI)
Its a broad field that involves the simulation or resemblance of human intelligence(how a human being thinks)
this includes the following algorithms
- learning(machine learning)
-reasoning 
- problem solving 
- Language understanding

Libraries 
- pytorch - Neural networks and deep learning 
- tensorflow 
- openCV
- NLTK _ for natural language processing

Installing the jupyter Notebook
pd is pandas
A class is always capitalized
methods are small letters beginning

Dataframe we have Methods and Classes
head to explain rows and columns of our data 
isnull is a method or function that identify missing values 
dataframe is a class 
A data frame is data structure that organizes data into two dimentional of rows and column 
.describe this describes the data 
how to merch data sets together 

we find the statistical methods by using describe 

Assignment
how to data clean 
we have a data set called users.json

Dataframes in pandas 
numpy for numeric operations 
an array isa array 
Array operations using nampy 
serie is a one demension list 
we use series when we are creating objects

why we use the normalize 
use of Filtered 


np array : a multi-dimensional array of items of the same type and size
Implace :  operations that modify an object directly without creating a new object
filter : filters a specific number the programmer has entered
Describe : we find statistical methods by using describe function
isnull : isnull function is to find out the missing values 
Groupby : allows you to group data based on a single column or more
mean : the average 
merged :Combine two Series or DataFrame objects with SQL-style joining.
head : displays the first five rows of the dataframe by default.



Series : A Series is a one-dimensional array of data.
Array :containers which are able to store more than one item at the same time
2 Dimentional array : an array of arrays that can be represented in matrix form, like rows and columns
map:  a function that works as an iterator to return a result after applying a function to every item of an iterable

when do we use a map function and a for loop

Data Science 
Refers to fixing of bad data in your data set 

The bad data could be :
- Empty cells 
- Data in a wrong format 
- Wrong data 
- Duplicates 

We use .Dropna to remove rows from our data 
Example 

import pandas as pd 
de=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
new_df=df.dropna()
print(new_df.to_string())

If you want to change the original dataframe we use inplace=true
 Example 

 import pandas as pd
 df=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
 df.dropna(inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

the inplace = true will not return a new dataframe,but will will remove all rows containing
 NULL values from the origin Data frame 

REPLACE EMPTY VALUES 

another way to deal with empty cells is to insert a new value instead 
This way you don not have delete entire rows just
 because of some empty cells 

 The fillna()method allows us to reolace empty cells with a value :
Example 

import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.fillna(13e0,inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

 # the to_string method in pandas is used to Convert a dataframe or series into a string represention 

 REPLACE ONLY FOR SPECIFIED COLUMNS WITH FILLNA 

The example above replaces all empty cells in the whole data frame 
To only replace empty values for one column,Specify the column name for Dataframe:

import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df['Calories'].fillna(130,inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

REPLACE WITH MEAN,MeDIAN OR MODE 
to replace with mean,median and mode we hav eto first calculate the (mean,mode and median)
Pandas use the mean(),median(),Mode() methods to calculate the respective values for a specifeid column 

Example 
import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
x=df["Calories'].mean()
df['Calories'].fillna(x,inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

Mean = (the sum of all values / by the number of Values)# average 

Example (MODE)

import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
x=df["Calories'].mode()
df['Calories'].fillna(x,inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

Example (median)

import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv('data.csv')
x=df["Calories'].mode()
df['Calories'].fillna(x,inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())


PANDAS CLEANING DATA OF WRONG FORMAT 

We data in a cell has a data with wrong format it can make it difficult or even impossible to analyze the data .
to do that , you hav etwo options either Removes the rows or convert all cella in the columns into the same format 

Pandas has a to_datetime() method for Dates 

Example 

Convert to Dates

import pandas as pd 
df=df.read_csv('data.csv')
df['Date']=pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df.dropna(subset=['Date'],inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

Removing Rows 
we can remove the rows by using the dropna()method 

Example 

df.dropna(subset=['Date'],inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())

# subset use ----------------

CLEANING WRONG DATA 
Wrong data doesnot have "Empty cells" orf "Wrong format" , it can just be wrong , just like if a person registered "200" instead of "2.00"
One can spot wrong data by looking at the Data set , because you have an expectation of what it should be .

REPLACE VALUES 

df.loc[7,'Duration']=45
print(df.to_string())

df.loc meaning in python used to retrieve the 
group of rows and columns by Labels or a boolean array in the Data frame .
Loc (Label Based)

if the data is big one can loop all over the data and if a specific if statement is notified it should change te data to a specific data 
 Example

 import pandas as pd
  df=pd.read_csv("data.csv")
  for x in df.index:
  if df.loc[x,'Duration'] > 120:
  df.loc[x,'Duration']=120
  print(df.to_string())

another way of handling wrong data is to remove the rows that contains wrong data 
This way you do not have to find out what to replace them with, and there is a good chance you do not need them to do your analysis

Example 

Delete rows where "Duration" is higher than 120 :
import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv("data.csv")
for x in df.index:
if df.loc[x,'Duration'] > 120:
df.drop(x,inplace=true)
# putting the the inplace = true arguemnet to make the changes in the original Dataframe object instead of returning a copy 
print(df.to_string)

DISCOVERING DUPLICATES 
To discover Duplicates we need to use the Duplicate() method 
the Duplicate() method returns a boolean values for each row:
Returns TRUE for each row that has a duplicate
Returns false for each row that doesnot have a duplicate

Example 

import pandas as pd 
df=pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.duplicate())


REMOVING DUPLICATES
to remove duplicates we need to use the drop_duplicate() method

Example 

import pandas as pd 
df=pd.read_csv("data.csv')
df.drop_duplicate(inplace=true)
print(df.to_string())


DATA CORRELATIONS (Finding relationships)
We can find that by using the corr() method 
the corr() method calculates the relationsships between each column in your data set 

import pandas as pd 
df=pf.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.corr())

A good correlation depends on the use , but i think it is safe o say you to have atleast 0.6(or -0.6)to call it a good correlation 

The method for vizualisation the data in the dataframes into a picture is df.plot()
scatter type of plot 
histogram type of plot
