Data Scienec:
-Data science is a multi displinary fild that uses scientific ,methods,processes,algorithms and 
 systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data
 (this involves data collection,cleaning,analysis and vizualisation)


 We basically dealing with data and the science init extracts the knowledge 
 data a meaningless information

 PYTHON IN DATA science

 Reasons for using python for data science 
 -widely used because of simplicity,readability and availability of powerful and free packages(libraries)
 - very simple 

 Basic libraries we shall be using : 

 pandas : data manupulation and analysis.
 Numpy : numerical operations
 Matiplotlib : data vizualisation
 scipy : data computing/ computation
 jupyter note book : analysis and data vizualisation


 MACHINE LEARNING 
    Is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on development of algorithms and statistical modules that enables computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on the given data 
algorithms(procedure of doing something/step by step daily routine of doing something )


python for machine learning

- A variety of frameworks and libraries

(libraries in machine learning)
1. Scikit-learn : general purpose machine learning library
2. Tensorflow : Deep learning 

Artificial intelligence(AI)
Its a broad field that involves the simulation or resemblance of human intelligence(how a human being thinks)
this includes the following algorithms
- learning(machine learning)
-reasoning 
- problem solving 
- Language understanding

Libraries 
- pytorch - Neural networks and deep learning 
- tensorflow 
- openCV
- NLTK _ for natural language processing 


DS involves extracting of data 
ML training the model , learning the data
AI Simulation(resemblance of human intelligence(thinking))
science fiction 

1.Supervised learning
2.unsupervised learning 

Data science-3years
Machine learning-3years
Artificial intelligence-3years

understanding data science we have to learn data structures

Scalar Vs Vector
single values   multiple values
numbers         Dictorianaries
string          array
Double          tuples
boolean         lists


the main we shall be using are : 
Json & Csv files 
how to access Api's and Url 


Installing the jupyter Notebook
